# Google-Location-Mapping
A script to correct and format and map Google location data from Google Takeout. Python to format, Mathematica to visualize.


Small project to take the raw format from google takeout location data and convert it into a CSV file that is easily readable with locations.
There is an additional Mathematica notebook that can read in this CSV and display locations with the Geomapping feature, easily adjusted to area of interest.
